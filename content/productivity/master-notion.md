If you only learn one Notion feature today, make it **Relations**.

## Why Relations Matter

Relations are the secret sauce that transforms Notion from a glorified notebook into a powerful second brain.

### What are Relations?

Relations let you connect different databases together. Think of them like links between Google Sheets, but way more powerful.

## Real Example

I have three databases:

- **Projects** - My active work
- **Tasks** - Individual to-dos
- **Notes** - Meeting notes and ideas

With Relations:

- Each Task links to a Project
- Each Note links to relevant Tasks and Projects
- I can see all Tasks for a Project in one view
- I can see all Notes related to a Task

## The 80/20 Rule

Master Relations and you'll unlock:

- ✅ Connected information (no more hunting)
- ✅ Automatic rollups (data flows between databases)
- ✅ Powerful filters and views
- ✅ A true "second brain" system

Start simple. Connect two databases today. Your future self will thank you.
