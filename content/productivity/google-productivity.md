I used to think I knew Google Workspace. Then I discovered these five tricks that literally save me 10+ hours every week.

## 1. Gmail Templates (Canned Responses)

Stop rewriting the same emails over and over.

**How to enable:**

- Settings → Advanced → Enable "Templates"
- Compose an email → Three dots → Templates → Save as new template

I have templates for:

- Meeting confirmations
- Project updates
- "Thanks but no thanks" responses

**Time saved:** 3 hours/week

## 2. Google Calendar Time Blocking

Block your calendar for deep work. If it's not on your calendar, it doesn't exist.

**My system:**

- 🔵 Deep work blocks (morning, 3 hours)
- 🟢 Meetings (afternoon only)
- 🟡 Email/admin (30 min chunks)
- 🔴 Personal time (non-negotiable)

**Time saved:** 4 hours/week (by saying no to bad meetings)

## 3. Drive Search Operators
